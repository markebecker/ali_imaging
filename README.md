spots_summarizing.R is for collating spots files spat out by Trackmate for each culture.
cilia_ref_perpix_230516_good.ipynb is for calculating the frequency & power of the signal of each pixel of the cilia videos. It may also contain code for matching up the ciliavid file name with info about the culture & timing of the video.

figs3.R is where I did all (?) the graphing and statistical analysis that made it into the manuscript.
s2.R is the last little bit of graphing for the manuscript (just supplementary figure 2).
